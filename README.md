# Travel Diary / World

A project rebuilt into a SpringBoot project from JEE 8 project.

Hopefully in the end it will be possible to have users list their travel ways around the world.

## Current REST end points:

Using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/ "Insomnia Rest Client") to check that my rest end points are working.

* /city  (Type: GET, fetches all cities in the database)
* /continent (Type: GET, fetches all continents in the database)

## Frontend

No frontend planned yet. Feel free to fork and build your own version.

I might do a Angular or Vue frontend one day, but for now, focus is 100% backend.

## Contact and Licence

It's an open source project. Used official data about population in different cities.

If you want to fork / clone it, feel free. If you want to hazzle about something is wrong,<br>
please don't. This is a project for learning purposes.
